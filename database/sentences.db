She runs fast
The sky is blue
He likes pizza
I have a cat
They play football
The book is big
She sings well
He reads books
The sun shines
It rains often
I drink tea
They swim fast
The dog barks
She dances gracefully
He eats apples
I love ice cream
They watch movies
The cat sleeps
She draws pictures
He writes letters
I play guitar
They ride bikes
The bird chirps
She cooks dinner
He speaks French
I learn English
They walk slowly
The car drives
She smiles warmly
He jumps high
I work hard
They talk loudly
The baby laughs
She studies math
He listens carefully
I run every day
They climb trees
The river flows
She paints beautifully
He fixes cars
I visit friends
They fly kites
The wind blows
She sleeps peacefully
He dreams often
I wake up early
They wait patiently
The clock ticks
She gardens happily
He builds houses
I clean my room
They play chess
The music plays
She shops quickly
He swims underwater
I bike to work
They skate gracefully
The children play
She teaches history
He studies science
I write poems
They dance together
The stars twinkle
She bakes cookies
He surfs waves
I take photos
They hike mountains
The flowers bloom
She plants seeds
He cooks dinner
I eat breakfast
They run marathons
The ocean roars
She enjoys reading
He plays piano
I watch TV
They smile often
The moon shines
She hugs tightly
He laughs loudly
I love my family
They help others
The fire burns
She paints walls
He fixes computers
I drive carefully
They study hard
The rain falls
She swims laps
He sings karaoke
I dance salsa
They ski downhill
The sun sets
She writes stories
He plays basketball
I listen to music
They paint portraits
The children laugh
She cooks lunch
He walks dogs
